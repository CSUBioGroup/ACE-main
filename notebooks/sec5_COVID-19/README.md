#### Integration of COVID-19 datasets

`ACE_covid19.py` reproduces ACE's outputs on COVID-19 datasets. 

Run: 
```Python
python ACE_covid19.py
```

`./checkpoints` folder contains the pretrained model weights, inputs and outputs of ACE in this task. Due to the limitation of file size, we have uploaded the complete data onto [`zenodo`](https://zenodo.org/records/10035793)

`prepare_CITE2_dataset.R` exports inputs from the bridge dataset.

`prepare_CYTOF-sampled_dataset.R` exports inputs from the CYTOF dataset.
